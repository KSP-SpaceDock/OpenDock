## OpenDock
OpenDock is an open source frontend for the [SpaceDock-Backend](https://github.com/KSP-SpaceDock/SpaceDock-Backend) software, an API backend for hosting game modifications.
This a project to develop a frontend that is capable of using the data provided by the SpaceDock-Backend API, to display a fully useable mod site. When it is finished, it has the potential to become the official frontend
used by [spacedock.info](https://spacedock.info).

### SDB Plugins
OpenDock requires the installation of plugins in the SDB instance it uses. These plugins are located in [SpaceDock-Extras](https://github.com/KSP-SpaceDock/SpaceDock-Extras), namely

* adapter
* ckan
* media
* search
* transformers

The `plugins.txt` file that gets used should look like this

```
github.com/KSP-SpaceDock/SpaceDock-Extras/plugins/adapter
github.com/KSP-SpaceDock/SpaceDock-Extras/plugins/ckan
github.com/KSP-SpaceDock/SpaceDock-Extras/plugins/media
github.com/KSP-SpaceDock/SpaceDock-Extras/plugins/search
github.com/KSP-SpaceDock/SpaceDock-Extras/plugins/transformers
```

### Web server

You'll need a PHP-enabled web server to run OpenDock.

If you have Apache2, you can point it to your OpenDock folder like this (modifying the paths as needed):

```apache2
	Alias "/OpenDock/" "/path/to/gopath/src/github.com/KSP-SpaceDock/OpenDock/"
	<Directory "/path/to/gopath/src/github.com/KSP-SpaceDock/OpenDock/">
		AllowOverride All
		Require all granted
	</Directory>
```

### Configuration

Copy `config.example.php` to `config.php` and edit to taste:

- `backend-url` should tell OpenDock how to access your running instance of [SpaceDock-Backend](https://github.com/KSP-SpaceDock/SpaceDock-Backend), in format `host:port` with no trailing slash.

```
'gameshort' => 'kerbal-space-program'
```
